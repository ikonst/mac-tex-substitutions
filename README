This project provides mappings between TeX sequences and Unicode text[1], and a way to import these mappings into OS X' list of text substitutions (as can be seen in System Preferences | Language & Text | Text).

The substitutions will function in most applications: make sure you enable text replacement in Edit | Substitutions | Text Replacement.

Usage: load.py map.json

The following mappings are available:
* tex.json - math TeX sequences
* ligatures.json - ligature TeX sequences
* combining.json - combining mark TeX sequences
