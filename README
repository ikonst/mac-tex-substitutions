NOTE: Currently the code doesn't work properly on OS X v10.9 Maverick.
Although the text replacements are functional, they disappear as soon
as one enters the Text pane of the Keyboard preferences. This is likely
related to the newly introduced iCloud "Documents & Data" synchronization.

This project provides mappings between TeX sequences and Unicode text[1],
and a way to import these mappings into OS X' list of text substitutions
(as can be seen in the Text pane of the Keyboard preferences (or the
Language & Text preferences prior to OS X v10.9 Maverick).

The substitutions will function in most applications: make sure
you enable text replacement in Edit | Substitutions | Text Replacement.

Usage: load.py map.json

The following mappings are available:
* tex.json - math TeX sequences
* ligatures.json - ligature TeX sequences
* combining.json - combining mark TeX sequences
