This project provides TeX-like symbol substitutions for OS X. It works by importing a predefined set of substitutions[1] into the global preferences.

The substitutions will function in most applications: make sure you enable text replacement in Edit | Substitutions | Text Replacement.

Usage: load.py file.json

* tex.json contains math TeX sequences
* ligatures.json contains ligature TeX sequences
* combining.json contains combining mark TeX sequences
